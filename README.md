# GameXperience Project

## Goal
The goal is to create a PHP framework running dungeon crawlers. The engine will allow interaction of heroes and enemies in dungeons of variable size, loot, leveling and more. The idea is to keep it as customizable as possible so that anyone can pick it up to set up their own dungeon crawler, may it be a game, as part of a bigger project or a tool for game masters.
